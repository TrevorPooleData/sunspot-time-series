# Sunspot Time Series Analysis (1700–2024)


## Introduction

Sunspot observations have been systematically recorded since 1700, forming one of the longest continuous datasets in astronomy (Arlt and Vaquero, 2020). These records are crucial for understanding long-term solar activity and its potential influence on Earth’s climate and space weather. The Royal Observatory of Belgium, through its Solar Influences Data Analysis Center (SIDC), has played a central role in compiling and maintaining the International Sunspot Number series. In 2015, this series underwent a major revision with the release of Version 2.0, which corrected historical inconsistencies and improved the homogeneity of the data (Clette and Lefèvre, 2015). The updated series incorporates recalibrated values based on a broader network of observing stations and refined methodologies, offering a more accurate representation of solar activity over time. These improvements enhance the reliability of long-term analyses and forecasting models that depend on historical sunspot data.

## Research Question

**“How can historical sunspot data from 1700 to 2024 be explored and visualised to assess data quality, and how can a model be developed to forecast sunspot activity from 2025 to 2050?**
